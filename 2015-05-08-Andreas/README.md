# extreme-startup
My extreme startup implementation for the codecentric extreme startup dojo

There are two folders included:

### -did
This folder contains the implementation I actually did on at the dojo. It doesn't do very much. I didn't have very much python experience, but I thought it would be fun to try out. Turns out it didn't. It took me forever to even get the regular expressions right (also regex aren't my favorite thing to tinker with). I didn't know how to write unit tests, so I created a test.py to test my code before I implemented it into the webserver class. It's a mess...

### -shouldhavedone
This folder contains an implementation I did afterwards. I took some time to figure out my problems, I learned a little bit about structuring python code and unit testing. Now it's a small nifty program that answers all the question of the extreme startup dojo. If you look closer you'll notice _lab files. I used those to write new function without disturbing the running code. I then tested those _lab files with unit tests. After I finished a function I copied them to the python file that was used by the web service.

### Lessons learned
Attending the dojo was extremely frustrating but in the long run it really motivated me to invest some time into python, which I find extremely interesting and I guess I will use it more often in the future.
