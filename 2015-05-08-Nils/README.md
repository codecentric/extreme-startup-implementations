# es-test

This is an example solution for the [extreme startup coding dojo](https://github.com/rchatley/extreme_startup). I wrote it for testing the server in preperation for a session we hosted at [codecentric AG](http://www.codecentric.de).

# Running the application

I've been using the lein-ring plugin, so you can start the application with
```lein ring server-headless```

# Notes

There aren't any test as I've been working mostly with the REPL. I added a test.check specification later, because I was playing around with property based testing. Also note that I haven't participated in the actual event and had a lot less pressure on me while coding this.
